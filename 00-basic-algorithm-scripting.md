## Basic Algorithm Scripting


### Reverse a String
Reverse the provided string.
You may need to turn the string into an array before you can reverse it.
Your result must be a string.


### Factorialize a Number
Return the factorial of the provided integer. If the integer is represented with the letter n, a factorial is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.Factorials are often represented with the shorthand notation n!

For example: 5! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120


### Check for Palindromes
Return true if the given string is a palindrome. Otherwise, return false.
A palindrome is a word or sentence that's spelled the same way both forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.


### Find the Longest Word in a String
Return the length of the longest word in the provided sentence.
Your response should be a number.


### Title Case a Sentence
Return the provided string with the first letter of each word capitalized. Make sure the rest of the word is in lower case.
For the purpose of this exercise, you should also capitalize connecting words like "the" and "of".
