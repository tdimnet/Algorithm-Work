Reverse the provided string.
You may need to turn the string into an array before you can reverse it.
Your result must be a string.

Return the factorial of the provided integer. If the integer is represented with the letter n, a factorial is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.Factorials are often represented with the shorthand notation n!

For example: 5! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120
